Statistical problems solved using Python.


##  (A)Frequency Problem

(a) You have to process one file, see below, and create a histogram that 
shows the number of occurences of the 2nd field in the file. 
On the Ox axis of the plot you will have the 2nd field in the file as a decimal number. 
On the Oy axis you will have the number of occurrences.

Here's the file:

cc1.din
The file was produced by capturing the addresses used by the CPU when compiling the CC compiler.
Each line in the file has two fields: 
the first field indicates what kind of operation the CPU performs (read, write, etc.),
and the second field is the address as a hexadecimal number. Here is what the number in the first field means:

0: read data
1: write data
2: instruction fetch
The second field is the address being referenced: the address is a hexadecimal byte-address between 0 and ULONG_MAX inclusively.

(b) What is the frequency of writes? What is the frequency of reads?




##  (B)Matrices Multiplication Problem

(a) Write a program that multiplies two rectangular matrices -- please no square matrices -- whose elements are randomly generated.
You will have two versions of the program, 
one in which matrix elements are integers and another one where they are real numbers (double).

Measure the time it takes each program to complete.
Since the matrices are randomly generated, you will have to run the program several times,
measure the running time and then calculate meaninful statistics related to the running time of your programs.

(b) Change your multiplication algorithm and repeat the steps above;
for instance, if you used the the naive multiplication algorith with the column in the inner loop,
then just use the same algorithm with the row in the inner loop.

Explain the differences in running time between the two versions of your multiplication algorithms.
